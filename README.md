# Todo-list

Simple task organizer.

[Live version.](https://mdlugosz1.github.io/todo-list/)

## How to use

<b>Tasks</b>

Add new task by clicking plus sign on the top of the page. Provide all necessary data, then just hit submit button and task will be added to the chosen project. With every task user can do following things:
* Show it's description by clicking task name
* Mark as finished by clicking checbox (task won't be removed from list)
* Edit task
* Remove task from project

User can also filter tasks only for today and for upcoming week by simply choosing this options from panel on the left side. Using this filter methods, all tasks from all project will be displayed on the screen.

<b>Projects</b>

Application has one build-in project which is "Inbox". This project should be used for single tasks that aren't part of the larger whole. Besides of that, user can add as many projects as needed by clicking plus sign in the left panel near 'Projects'. Every project that was added by user can be removed by clicking trash can icon. BEWARE: removing project will also remove all tasks that were assigned to that project.

## Objectives

My main goal when creating this project was to follow OOP principles and make every main module (todolist, projects, tasks, menu, content) as separate from each other as possible so if necessary they could work on their own.
